# RS School AWS DevOps Course Task 3

In this task I will use the same code as we have used before, I only had to amend security group rules a little bit to make sure instances are in full contact between each other. 
The most important thing added is user data for our private instances. I also added outputs with IP adresses to make access easier.

When we know the IPs we can use bastion host to access the server via Bastion host and run some kubectl commands.

Our Kubernetes cluster is up and running!
